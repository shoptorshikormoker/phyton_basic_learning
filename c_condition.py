#condition
if 5 > 3:

#Elif: The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

  print("b is greater than a")

 # else: The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

#Short Hand If ... Else: If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
